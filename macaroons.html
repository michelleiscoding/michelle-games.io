    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p> Mix your almond flour and your powdered sugar and then put it through a sifter until there are no clumps, then whip the egg whites and salt until soft peaks form, then add in the granulated sugar, lemon extract, and a little bit of food coloring. Then put the powdered sugar mixture with the whipped eggs and slowly mix it together. With that mixure then use your number 12 tip and piping bag to pipe small circles that are about and inch away from each other. Preheat you oven to 300 degrees and bake your batter for 17 minutes then let the macaron shells completely cool. Get your buttercream frosting and add the lemon zest in and then mix and apply on macarons.(optional: For decoration, if you want, apply a light coat of lemon juice on the shell and stick edible pearls on.) Now enjoy your Pink Lemonade Macarons!</p>
